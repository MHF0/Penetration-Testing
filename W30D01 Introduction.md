# Introduction Penetration-Testing

## High Level Goals

By the end of this Stage, you will be familiar with the following:
- Virtual Lap
- Enumeration & Information
- Burp Suite
- HTML Injection
- Command Injection + Execution
- Broken Authentication
- Bruteforce Attacks
- Access Control
- XSS
- SQL Injection
- XPath, XXE
- Logging + Monitoring
- Bug Hunting

## Virtual Lap

### What is Virtual Lap
Virtual labs are simulated learning environments that allow students to complete laboratory experiments online and explore concepts and theories without stepping into a physical science lab.

### What we will learn
We will learn how to download and use this following:
1. Virtual Box.
2. Kali Linux.
3. OWASPBWA.
4. TryHackMe Platform.

## Enumeration & Information

### What is Enumeration & Information
Enumeration is defined as the process of extracting user names, machine names, network resources, shares and services from a system.

In this phase, the attacker creates an active connection to the system and performs directed queries to gain more information about the target. The gathered information is used to identify the vulnerabilities or weak points in system security and tries to exploit in the System gaining phase.

### What is the wensite we will use to Enumeration & Information
- Google Dorking.
- WhatWeb.
- Dirb.
- Nmap.
- Nikto.

## Burpsuite

### What is Burpsuite used for

Burp or Burp Suite is a set of tools used for penetration testing of web applications. ... BurpSuite aims to be an all in one set of tools and its capabilities can be enhanced by installing add-ons that are called BApps. It is the most popular tool among professional web app security researchers and bug bounty hunters.

## HTML Injection 

###  What is HTML Injection
HTML injection is a type of injection vulnerability that occurs when a user is able to control an input point and is able to inject arbitrary HTML code into a vulnerable web page. This vulnerability can have many consequences, like disclosure of a user’s session cookies that could be used to impersonate the victim, or, more generally, it can allow the attacker to modify the page content seen by the victims.

## Command Injection

### What is Command Injection
Command injection is an attack in which the goal is execution of arbitrary commands on the host operating system via a vulnerable application. we will talk about it later.

## Broken Authentication

### What is Broken Authentication
Authentication is “broken” when attackers are able to compromise passwords, keys or session tokens, user account information, and other details to assume user identities. Due to poor design and implementation of identity and access controls, the prevalence of broken authentication is widespread.

### Brute Force Attack

A brute force attack uses trial-and-error to guess login info, encryption keys, or find a hidden web page. Hackers work through all possible combinations hoping to guess correctly.

These attacks are done by ‘brute force’ meaning they use excessive forceful attempts to try and ‘force’ their way into your private account(s).

This is an old attack method, but it's still effective and popular with hackers. Because depending on the length and complexity of the password, cracking it can take anywhere from a few seconds to many years.

## Broken Access Control

## What is Broken Access Control
Broken access control vulnerabilities exist when a user can in fact access some resource or perform some action that they are not supposed to be able to access.
